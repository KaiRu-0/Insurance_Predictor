# Insurance_Predictor

This project involves predicting insurance charges based on various features using a Linear Regression model. The data is preprocessed and split into training and testing sets to evaluate the performance of the model.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following modules:

- `data_processing.py`: Contains functions for loading, preprocessing, and splitting the dataset.
- `model.py`: Contains functions for training and evaluating the Linear Regression model.
- `prediction.py`: Contains functions for making predictions with the trained model.
- `main.py`: The main script that integrates all the modules and performs the end-to-end workflow.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the required Python libraries installed. You can install all dependencies using the `requirements.txt` file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
